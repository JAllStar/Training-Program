# Contributing
### Before creating PR
* Clone repository to local. (Use pull command to update the local repository in the future.)
* Checkout a new branch on local. Add a new feature in the new branch.
* Push new feature branch to Github.

### Process for merging a PR
* Create a Pull Request and get two approval reviews.
* Merge the feature branch to main branch.

### After PR merged (Ignore this one for now)
* PRs will trigger builds and help you  validate changes in dev environment.
* It's the responsibility of the committer, to ensure the service availability is not impacted.
* Running through integration tests should ensure all features old and new are tested.
